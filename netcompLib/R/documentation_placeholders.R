#'
#' @section Purpose:
#'   The output adjustment for functions in this package (especially the simulation functions) have multiple parts to it, and has a common format for all functions. 
#' 
#' @section Parameters:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item verbose [logical] :: Function prints progress if TRUE. In simple settings, this may be the only function parameter
#'     \item vbset [vector[3]-int] :: The entries of this vector corresponds to: (Note that all negative values in this vector are treated as zeros)
#'     \itemize{
#'       \item vbset[1] - The number of functions and levels of within-function-calls that will produce output. eg. If this is set to 1, only this function (but none of the functions it calls) will produce output. 
#'       \item vbset[2] - The number of functions and levels of within-function-calls that will produce detailed output. This should be at most the value of vbset[1]... 
#'       \item vbset[3] - The number of filler characters. This is usually incremented by 2 on each function call (so within-function-calls have output that is indented)
#'     }
#'   }
#' 
#' @section Programming Notes:
#'   When calling a function, vbset_new = vbset + c(-1, -1, 2). This says to reduce the number of levels of output in the called function, as well as increase the indentation. 
#' 
#' @return [] :: Nothing -- this function should not be called. 
#' 
#' @export
#'
